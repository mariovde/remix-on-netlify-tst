- [Customer Dashboard](https://remix.run/dashboard)

## Setup

Set the environment variable `REMIX_TOKEN` to your licence key from the Remix dashboard. If your site repo is not public, you could edit `.npmrc` and hard-code the value, but be careful to not commit it to a public repo.

## Development

To run the Remix dev server, run:

```
$ npm run dev

```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

## Deploying

In the Netlify dashboard, set the environment variable `REMIX_TOKEN` to your licence key from the Remix dashboard. Then when you deploy to Netlify, everything should work.
